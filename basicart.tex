\section{First Section}
Here is the first section you can use a variety of different tools, in this case I use TeXmaker with MacTeX. This is a basic document so everything is on one page, for larger projects you would break them and have a separate bibtex file for you references, and break chapters up into separate files.

\subsection{Compile Twice}
Often you will have to `compile twice' using \textit{pdflatex} so as referencing is done correctly.
